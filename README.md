This project is a full-stack Library Management System built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It provides a complete workflow for managing books in a library, including adding new books, updating details, deleting records, and viewing all available books in a clean user interface. The backend is designed using Node.js and Express to handle API requests securely, while MongoDB stores all book data in a structured manner. The frontend is built with React to deliver a responsive, user-friendly experience, allowing users to interact with the system smoothly. This project demonstrates how a full-stack application works end-to-end by connecting the client and server through REST APIs. It is ideal for learners who want to understand real-world CRUD operations, API integration, and modular code structure in a modern web development environment.
